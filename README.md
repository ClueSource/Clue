IOT based tracking suite

The implications and the application of IoT is currently a huge research area. We are concentrating on the tracking aspect of the IoT.
In this project we have created a tracking suite that contains the following components:
Arduino based sensor which collects location data from the GPS module and relays it to the server using the GSM module.
A central server which acts as the primary data synchronizer.
A web client that enables users to access the services of the ‘Clue!’
A mobile application that can act as a
Client to avail the services.
Tracker accessing the data from the GPS module and relaying it to the server.
The whole issue that we are trying to solve is to provide an easy to use product using which we will be able to track objects to which our 
Arduino module is attached, and users who have activated out service on their mobile phones. 
Apart from this we create a smart social network in which 
people meet new friends who have the same taste of interest, and are currently close by.
